# App.KNEEL.SPACE

KNEEL.SPACE App Project

## Synopsis

This project is the mobile app for the KNEEL.SPACE prayer platform created by
Greg Marine.

## Motivation

KNEEL.SPACE is the next generation of the Internet Community Church prayer chain
started in January 1999. This app represents the mobile extension of the prayer
platform. The KNEEL.SPACE platform can be seen as an individual's personal
space on the Internet to kneel and pray to the Creator of all things. Making the
platform available on-the-go is what this project is all about.

## Technology
